Creating a Pricing Page (or Pricing Landing Page) involves presenting the cost of your products or services in a clear, persuasive, and easy-to-understand format. A great pricing page does more than just list pricesâ€”it helps convert visitors into customers by highlighting the value of your offering.

ðŸ§¾ What Is a Pricing Landing Page?
A Pricing Landing Page is a standalone web page focused entirely on presenting the pricing options of a product or service. It is often designed to:
Showcase different pricing tiers/packages.
Explain what each plan includes.
Highlight the value customers get.
Encourage visitors to make a purchase or subscribe.
